# Colorful Turtle Spiral 🐢🎨

This project uses Python's `turtle` module to draw a colorful spiral pattern.

## How it works
- The turtle moves forward a little more each time
- It turns 30 degrees after every line
- The colors cycle through blue, red, and green
- The increasing distance creates a spiral effect

## Requirements
- Python 3
- The built-in `turtle` module (no extra installation needed)

## How to run
```bash
python colorful_spiral.py
